    `The **current ratio** measures a companyâ€™s ability to pay its **short-term obligations**â€”those due within a year. It provides insights into how effectively a company can utilize its current assets to cover its current debts and other payables. Investors and analysts use the current ratio to evaluate a companyâ€™s financial health.

## **Formula and Calculation:**
To calculate the current ratio, we compare a companyâ€™s **current assets** to its **current liabilities**. Letâ€™s break it down:
- 1 **Current Assets**: These are assets that are either cash or expected to be converted into cash within a year. They include items like cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. \n
- 2 **Current Liabilities**: These are obligations that will be settled within a year. Examples include accounts payable, short-term debts, and taxes payable.
