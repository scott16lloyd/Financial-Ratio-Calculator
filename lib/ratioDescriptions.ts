    `The **current ratio** measures a company’s ability to pay its **short-term obligations**—those due within a year. It provides insights into how effectively a company can utilize its current assets to cover its current debts and other payables. Investors and analysts use the current ratio to evaluate a company’s financial health.

## **Formula and Calculation:**
To calculate the current ratio, we compare a company’s **current assets** to its **current liabilities**. Let’s break it down:
- 1 **Current Assets**: These are assets that are either cash or expected to be converted into cash within a year. They include items like cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. \n
- 2 **Current Liabilities**: These are obligations that will be settled within a year. Examples include accounts payable, short-term debts, and taxes payable.

\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}

It provides insights into how effectively a company can use its quick assets to cover its current liabilities. Investors and analysts use the Quick Ratio to evaluate a company's short-term liquidity.
  
  ## **Formula and Calculation:**
  To calculate the Quick Ratio, we compare a company's **Quick Assets** to its **Current Liabilities**. Let's break it down:
  - 1 **Quick Assets**: These are assets that can be quickly converted into cash or are already in cash form. They include items like cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable.
  - 2 **Current Liabilities**: These are obligations that will be settled within a year. Examples include accounts payable, short-term debts, and taxes payable.

    `The **Debt to Equity Ratio** measures a company's financial leverage. It provides insights into the balance between the company's total debt and its shareholders' equity. Investors and analysts use the Debt to Equity Ratio to evaluate a company's financial risk.
  
  ## **Formula and Calculation:**
  To calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio, we compare a company's **Total Liabilities** to its **Shareholders' Equity**. Let's break it down:
  - 1 **Total Liabilities**: These are all the debts and obligations owed by the company. They include both current liabilities (debts due within one year) and long-term liabilities (debts due in more than one year).
  - 2 **Shareholders' Equity**: Also known as net assets, it's the difference between total assets and total liabilities. It represents the net value of the company to its owners or shareholders.

    `The **Price to Earnings (P/E)** ratio measures the market value per share relative to the company's earnings per share (EPS). It provides insights into the dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company in order to receive one dollar of that company’s earnings.

  ## **Formula and Calculation:**
  To calculate the P/E ratio, we compare a company's **Market Value per Share** to its **Earnings per Share (EPS)**. Let's break it down:
  - 1 **Market Value per Share**: This is the current share price of the company's stock in the open market.
  - 2 **Earnings per Share (EPS)**: This is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It's calculated by dividing net income by the number of outstanding shares.
